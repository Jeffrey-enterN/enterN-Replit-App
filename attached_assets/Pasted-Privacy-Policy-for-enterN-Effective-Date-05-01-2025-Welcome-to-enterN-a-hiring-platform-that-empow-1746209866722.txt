Privacy Policy for enterN
Effective Date: 05/01/2025
Welcome to enterN, a hiring platform that empowers early-career jobseekers and employers to find meaningful, bias-resistant matches through anonymized, preference-based profiles. Your privacy is important to us, and this Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your personal information.

Information We Collect
We collect the following types of information from jobseekers, employers, and website visitors:
a. Information You Provide Directly
Jobseekers: Name, email address, educational background, work preferences, skills, anonymized profile responses, and feedback on job opportunities.
Employers: Business name, recruiter contact info, job descriptions, company preferences, and hiring behavior data (e.g., match selections, response rates).
Messages and Support Requests: Any information you voluntarily submit through messages, forms, or support interactions.


b. Automatically Collected Data
IP address, browser type, operating system
Device identifiers, usage logs, referral sources
Interactions with the site (clicks, time spent, swipe history)


c. Third-Party Integrations
If you connect with third-party services (e.g., a university Single Sign-On system, LinkedIn, or Google), we may receive additional information such as your profile, email, or verified educational details.

How We Use Your Information
We use your data to:
Match jobseekers and employers based on preferences and fit
Improve our AI recommendation systems
Provide transparency tools like BooBase for ghosting reports
Conduct analytics and improve product performance
Communicate with users via email or in-platform messaging
Ensure safety, prevent fraud, and comply with legal obligations


We never sell your personal data. Period.

Data Sharing and Disclosure
We only share your data in the following situations:
With Employers (Jobseeker-Specific): Only after mutual interest is expressed (e.g., both sides swipe right). Your anonymized preferences may guide matching prior to revealing your identity.
With Jobseekers (Employer-Specific): Only after the employer expresses interest. We may share job details, hiring patterns, and employer behavior labels (e.g., Power Responder).
With Service Providers: We work with vetted vendors who support our platform (e.g., cloud hosting, email services, analytics).
With Consent: We’ll get your permission before sharing anything outside of expected platform use.
For Legal Reasons: We may disclose data if legally required (e.g., subpoena, law enforcement request).

Access the personal data we hold about you
Correct or update your information

Data Security
We implement strong security measures to protect your data, including:

Regular audits and security reviews


However, no system is 100% secure. We urge you to use strong passwords and report suspicious activity immediately.

Data Retention
We retain your information:
As long as your account is active
As needed to fulfill matching, legal, or operational requirements
For analytics purposes, unless you request deletion


You may delete your account at any time in your settings or by contacting support@entern.co.
