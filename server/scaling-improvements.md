# Scaling Improvements for enterN

This document outlines critical scaling improvements needed to handle hundreds or thousands of users.

## Database Query Inefficiencies

### 1. Match Feed Query in `match-utils.ts`

**Problem:**
- `getEmployerMatchFeed` function loads ALL jobseekers, regardless of page size
- No pagination means large result sets
- Sorts in memory rather than using database sorting 
- Excessive logging slows down processing
- No caching for repeated requests

**Solution:**
- Implement pagination with limit/offset parameters
- Add database indexes for frequently queried columns
- Move sorting to the database layer
- Cache match results with short TTL (1-2 minutes)
- Reduce logging in production

### 2. Swipe Processing Transaction Issues

**Problem:**
- `processJobseekerSwipe` and `processEmployerSwipe` perform multiple queries in a single transaction
- Transaction locks can cause bottlenecks with concurrent users
- No retry mechanism on transaction failure

**Solution:**
- Optimize transaction scope to minimize lock duration
- Add retry logic with exponential backoff for failed transactions
- Add database indexes for swipe-related queries

### 3. Job Interest Query Performance

**Problem:**
- `expressJobInterest` loads entire job record with nested company relations
- Uses eager loading for all employees regardless of need
- No validation of data before DB operations

**Solution:**
- Use selective querying to load only necessary fields
- Add pagination and limits to all list operations
- Add proper indexes for job interest table

## Authentication System Weaknesses

### 1. Session Management

**Problem:**
- Excessive session data stored in database
- No session pruning mechanism
- Every API request triggers multiple session reads/writes

**Solution:**
- Implement session cleanup cron job
- Reduce session size by storing only essential data
- Add session caching layer

### 2. Mobile Token Implementation

**Problem:**
- Lacks proper expiration handling
- Tokens stored directly in local storage
- No token rotation or refresh mechanism

**Solution:**
- Add token expiration
- Implement secure token storage
- Add token refresh mechanism

## WebSocket Implementation Issues

**Problem:**
- No rate limiting or connection throttling
- Inefficient reconnection strategy
- Debug logging in production code
- No stress testing done for concurrent connections

**Solution:**
- Add rate limiting based on user ID
- Implement proper connection pooling
- Remove debug logging in production
- Add stress testing for websocket connections

## Memory Management Issues

**Problem:**
- In-memory operations on large datasets
- No cleanup for temp data
- No monitoring for memory usage

**Solution:**
- Stream large result sets instead of loading into memory
- Implement proper cleanup for temp data
- Add memory monitoring and alerting

## Implementation Priority

1. Database query optimizations (most critical)
2. Memory management improvements
3. Authentication system enhancements
4. WebSocket scaling fixes

These improvements will significantly enhance the application's ability to scale to thousands of users.
