About The Role
Responsibilities (What They’ll Do)
If Multiple Users for Enterprise Organization
Initial Setup Will Make Superuser - they can assign this role to others
Can invite other users from their organization (must have matching email domain)
Each user has their own independent match feed
Each user can only see their own dashboard/metrics
Superuser can see all users’ dashboard/metrics individually or for the organization
Employer Match Feed
First Queue: Jobseekers at a specific job fair (If not at a job fair, enter in at Second Queue)
Second Queue: Jobseekers local to hiring location(s) or with those locations set as preferred locations
Third Queue: All jobseekers on the platform
Employer will swipe left (reject) or swipe right (interest) to indicate if they wish to connect with jobseekers
If a jobseeker swipes right (interest) on an employer, the employer will receive a notification indicating there is a new match; if it happens at the time of the swipe, they will be prompted on-screen
Once a symmetric match is made, the employer may send up to three (3) posted jobs to the jobseeker; they will wait for that jobseeker to verify interest in the specific role
✅ (Interest) → Proceed to Communication | ❌ (Reject) → Return to Match Feed
Employer/Jobseeker Communication
The employer user can pre-load their profile with a calendar scheduling link (calendly, similar) so that when there is verified interest in a specific role, the jobseeker can self-schedule an interview
The employer user can pre-load their profile with an invite to apply link that will direct matched jobseekers to their applicant tracking system (less preferred)
The employer can contact the jobseeker within the app using an internal messaging system
The employer can contact the jobseeker outside of the app using email or phone
Status Updates
The employer will have three metrics for step/status:
Matches
Interview
Offer
The individual job postings will have three metrics for step status:
Open
Filled
Expired

Jobseeker Match Feed
First Queue: Employers at their job fair
✅ Interested → Adds This User to the Employer’s Match Feed
❌ Not Interested → Does Not Add This User to the Employer’s Match Feed
Second Queue: Employers in preferred locations
✅ Interested → Adds This User to the Employer’s Match Feed
❌ Not Interested → Does Not Add This User to the Employer’s Match Feed
Third Queue: All employers on the app
✅ Interested → Adds This User to the Employer’s Match Feed
❌ Not Interested → Does Not Add This User to the Employer’s Match Feed
If the jobseeker has not yet encountered an employer on their match feed, they are visible by default until they swipe left (not interested) on a specific employer. 
If the jobseeker swipes left on a specific user, their profile is hidden from all employer users for that specific employer
Job Sharing & Interest Verification
Once a mutual match occurs, the employer is notified and can share up to three (3) job postings with the jobseeker user
The jobseeker will review each posting and can utilize the same swipe mechanic to indicate their interest with either a left swipe (not interested) or a right swipe (interested)
Upon confirmation of interest from a jobseeker user to a specific role, their name and contact information are revealed to the employer and the employer user receives a push notification of that update and communication should begin
Employer/Jobseeker Communication
The employer user can pre-load their profile with a calendar scheduling link (calendly, similar) so that when there is verified interest in a specific role, the jobseeker can self-schedule an interview
The employer user can pre-load their profile with an invite to apply link that will direct matched jobseekers to their applicant tracking system (less preferred)
The employer can contact the jobseeker within the app using an internal messaging system
The employer can contact the jobseeker outside of the app using email or phone
Notes & Suggestions
There should be a timer when push notifications are sent; at 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours the users should be ‘nudged’ to take action
For the employer super user it would be highly desired for that user to be able to act as a proxy on any other employer user accounts that are within the same employer - this would allow team members to ensure matches are addressed in a reasonable timeframe if someone is out or if there is a change in personnel
For posting jobs, it is critical that some form of API integration is implemented in the MVP or at least the foundation for that to occur in a very early update for employers to sync their job postings from their career site or ATS into the enterN platform
Required at the MVP level for posting jobs is the option for employers to input a URL for a job and the platform will parse that job description for the required fields within the system, there should be a fallback for manual input if there is a parsing failure
