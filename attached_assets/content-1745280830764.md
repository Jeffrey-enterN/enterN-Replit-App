# RESUMES ARE BULLSH!T

The hiring process is broken. The resume is outdated and no longer meets the demands of this digital age of applicant tracking systems. Jobseekers either utilize AI to write their resume or spend way too much paying a professional resume writer to plug in keywords like an SEO specialist, or they outright lie to try and best the 'system'. Meanwhile, ATS are poorly programmed and are known to screen out perfectly qualified candidates regularly. The initial review is loaded with bias, and employers screen out candidates based on arbitrary things like their name, email address, or even their phone number's prefix. The spend less than eight seconds reviewing a resume that holds little weight in the ultimate hiring decision. Employers and jobseekers alike waste hundreds of hours, money and resources, and nearly half of the time it ends with one party being ghosted...​​

#### enterN is changing this.

# What is enterN?

![](https://static.wixstatic.com/media/ff3e97_1be940481bbd4282af981bf9942ed2e6~mv2.png/v1/fill/w_610,h_270,al_c,q_85,usm_0.66_1.00_0.01,enc_avif,quality_auto/ff3e97_1be940481bbd4282af981bf9942ed2e6~mv2.png)

enterN is a revolutionary hiring platform for early talent - built from the ground up to replace the resume with meaningful, data-driven insights. The platform connects employers only with the jobseekers with verified interests in the prospect of working at their organization. Then, it shows an anonymized profile created with an array of data points based on skills, work preferences, organizational fit, and cultural fit. These profiles eliminate the opportunity for implicit bias to impact the initial screening decisions while giving the employer insights that typically wouldn't be known until well after an initial call was done.

​

For employers, enterN eliminates time wasted calling and screening unqualified or uninterested jobseekers by showing them clear insights into what they are looking for in their next role.

​

For jobseekers, enterN provides control over their search - allowing them transparency on their work preferences and power over which employers they engage with.

​

The process drives more meaningful connections by providing data that enables better decision making. enterN is essentially a fast-forward button for the hiring process, and for most users, it takes less than 10 seconds to make a more informed decision than a resume could ever facilitate.

We envision a future where hiring is truly equitable and accessible to all, where opportunity is based on potential and where someone wants to go - rather than where they've been. We believe in automating as much of the repetitive nature of the hiring process as possible so that jobseekers and employers can get back to building great connections. By eliminating resumes, we remove implicit bias from that process and ensure that jobseekers are evaluated for what they can bring to the team - and what the team can provide.

​

Through data-driven insights and intuitive AI, enterN empowers employers to make better hiring decisions by matching candidates based on organizational and cultural fit - the factors determining long-term success. Starting in the early talent space, we are redefining how jobseekers and employers connect, making the hiring process faster, less stressful, and more effective.

> "I had applied for over 200 internships in the FinTech space and hadn't been called for a single interview. I was able to complete my profile in five minutes and the enterN process brought me four interviews and two job offers.

Esmerelda S

Jobseeker

> "I was skeptical of reviewing candidates without seeing their resumes - and after using the enterN process I realized how unhelpful the resume is in making decisions. Being able to see what drives the applicant is brilliant and very useful."

Sarah L

Employer

> "I typically spend 8 hours at a career fair talking to students and then 10 - 14 hours sorting the resumes and deciding who to call. All in, there is about 40 hours for each hire. The enterN process helped me shorten that to under four hours!"
